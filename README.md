# Nested HTML Tags

## Objective

- Practice nesting HTML tags within each other

## Instructions

HTML tags can be nested within each other, allowing us to organize
a web page's content and _mark up_ what things are stored inside.

Work through the challenges below one at a time, writing the solutions in
`index.html`. Run `learn` to verify you've written a correct solution for each.
If you would like to see your work as you go, use `httpserver` or open
`index.html` to view the results of your work. Make sure to add text inside tags
to see how each one modifies the displayed text.

The `body` tag will always contain _all the displayed content_ of a web page.
Every example in this lab will be nested somewhere within `body`.

#### 1) Add a `h1` tag inside the `body` tag

#### 2) Add a `li` tag inside a `ul` tag

#### 3) Add a `span` tag inside a `main` tag

#### 4) Add a `header` tag inside an `article` tag

#### 5) Add an `h4` tag inside a `aside` tag

#### 6) Add a `strong` tag and an `em` tag inside a `p` tag

#### 7) Add a `summary` tag inside a `details` tag

#### 8) Add a `q` tag inside a `div` tag

#### 9) Add a `del` tag and an `ins` tag inside an `address` tag

#### 10) Add a `mark` tag inside an `h3` tag inside a `section` tag

## Conclusion

There are many HTML tags, each with a specific purpose. Don't worry if some of
these seem unfamiliar. You can always [check online][tags] to see how a tag is
used before trying it. By writing tags within each other, web browsers can use
our HTML to structure the content we see on a web page.

The purpose of this lab is to show that this it is possible to have many layers
of nested HTML.
